# Exercises for Chapter 8

There are no exercises for Chapter 8 in the Instructor's Manual either but you can again improve the Nutrilicious app.

How about fleshing out the app into an actual nutrition tracking app?
* Let users enter the amounts they ate of each food
* Show users the percentages of each nutrient they ate so far that day
 * If you want to be better than even popular tracking apps, give users recommendations for foods they should eat during the rest of the day to best cover their nutrient needs (and consider selling your app in the app store :smiley:)
* Let users set personalized targets for each nutrient, for instance depending on their gender, weight, height, age, and activity level

And again, implementing your own app idea is another fantastic option!

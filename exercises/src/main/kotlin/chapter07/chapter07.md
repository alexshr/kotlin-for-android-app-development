# Exercises for Chapter 7

There are no exercises for Chapter 7 in the Instructor's Manual but you
can of course improve your Kudoo to-do app.

Here are some ideas for inspiration:
* Let users add an optional description text to their to-do items
* Let users add a priority to their to-do items
 * Enable users to sort to-dos by priority inside MainActivity
* Allow users to delete a to-do by swiping the item
* Instead of deleting to-dos right away, archive them first and give users the option to delete them

Of course, implementing your own app idea is another fantastic option!

In Chapter 8, you'll implement a larger app to gain some more experience with Kotlin on Android. If you tried the ideas above but struggled with them, maybe try again after going through Chapter 8.

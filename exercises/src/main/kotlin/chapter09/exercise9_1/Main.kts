/*
 * There are a million different ways to design this DSL. One extremely useful feature here is to have extension
 * properties for the units (such as mg and g) and infix function `of` that allows the code to read almost like a recipe.
 *
 * There are certainly many ways to flesh this DSL out further, and I encourage you to do so if you want to gather more
 * experience building DSLs in Kotlin.
